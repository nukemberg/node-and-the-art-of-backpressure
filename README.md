# Node and the Art of Backpressure

Backpressure and flow management are fundamental required for reliable integration of your Node servers with the rest of the system. Backpressure is relatively natural in synchronous runtimes but Node's async nature requires us to be mindful of it in our code.

This talk explains backpressure, why it is important and how to properly implement it in Node.js.
